ContourLines
============

Repository for development of information exchange for linear spatial features.
 interchange format for linear spatial features representing contour (isoline) data. These lines connect locations registering the same value for some variable. Examples include structure contour maps that represent lines of constant elevation on some surface, or gravity anomaly contours that represent lines of constant anomaly value. Fields in the content model will become XML elements in interchange documents for WFS simple features served by geothermal data web services.
